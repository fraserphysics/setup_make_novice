make-lesson
===========

Files and programs for learners to go with the *make-novice* lesson.
The files are in a git repository.  There is a branch for each
episode.  As we finish each episode, we suggest that you use git to
save your work on that episode and then use git to checkout the basis
for the next episode.  Here are the branches:
